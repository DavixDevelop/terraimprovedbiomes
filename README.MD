## TerraPlusPlus: Improved Biomes Add-on

### What is it?
 Improved Biomes Add-on is a mod that replaces the default low resoultion biome mapping in TerraPlusPlus with a high resoultion biome mapping based on the 1km Köppen-Geiger climate classification map.  The mapping from the climate classification to Minecraft biomes is based on the [BIOMES Minecraft Earth Map](https://earth.motfe.net/2019/01/17/biomes/) provided by @mattiborchers.

### Current Biome Map
As mentioned before, The mapping from the climate classification to Minecraft biomes is based on the BIOMES Minecraft Earth Map, which results as the following biome map:

### Future plans
In a future release the biome mapping will be based on the Copernicus Global Dynamic Land Cover (ex. open/closed forest, type of forest, shrubland...) map of resolutin of either 100m or 2m in combination with the current 1km Köppen-Geiger climate classification map to create even a higer resoultion/quality biome map.
